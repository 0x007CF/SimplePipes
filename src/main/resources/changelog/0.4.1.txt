Changes:

* Exposed "TilePipeWood.tryExtract(int redstone_pulses)" for addon devs to use for more powerful engines.
* Added sponge pipes!
    * These filter out impurities in water, leaving it a clear light-blue.
    * Filtered water is functionally identical to unfiltered water.
    * Mods may add machines which require filtered water however, but this isn't the default behaviour.

Bug Fixes:

* [#42] Iron pipes didn't face inventories (Kneelawk)
* [#45] Diamond Pipes only drop item in first filter slot when broken.
